üß© Additional Enhancements to Consider:

1. Input Validation
   - Ensure values are within expected ranges.
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., empty input, duplicate entries).

2. Logging (Optional for Larger Projects)
   - Use `java.util.logging` or a logging framework like Log4j for better debugging and monitoring.

3. Unit Testing
   - Use JUnit to write tests for your methods.
   - Helps ensure correctness and maintainability.

4. Code Formatting
   - Follow standard indentation and spacing.
   - Use tools like Checkstyle or SpotBugs for static analysis.

5. Use of Constants
   - Avoid magic numbers; define constants with meaningful names.

6. Encapsulation (if using classes)
   - Use private fields and public getters/setters.
   - Promotes data hiding and better object-oriented design.

7. Comments for Complex Logic
   - Inline comments for non-obvious logic help future maintainers.

8. Versioning and Author Tags
   - Include `@version`, `@author`, and `@since` in JavaDocs.

9. Code Reusability
   - Avoid duplication; reuse methods where possible.
